# 2022-CS31-Project-3

Introduction
You work for a polling company. Control of the House of Representatives is of major interest in the upcoming election, so polls are conducted in various states to predict how many of those states' congressional seats will go to each party. The data from the polls is encoded in a string that you will need to process. We will describe the format of the string and what you must do to process it.

First, we define some terms.
A letter is one of the 52 letter characters A through Z and a through z.
A state code is one of the following 50 two-letter codes, with each letter being in either upper or lower case (so CA Ca cA and ca are all state codes): AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MA MD MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY
A digit is one of the ten digit characters 0 through 9.
A party code is a letter, with upper and lower case versions being treated the same way. (The intent is that different letters represent different parties, e.g., D or d for Democratic, R or r for Republican, I or i for Independent, L for Libertarian, G for Green, and other letters for other minor parties).
A party result is exactly one or two digits immediately followed by a party code. For example, 14D and 6r and 01i and 0G are party results; 4 D is not, because of the space character between the 4 and the D. (The intent is that the digit(s) represent the number of seats that party is expected to win in some state.)
A state forecast is a state code immediately followed by zero or more party results. For example, CT5D and ne3r00D and NY9R16D1I and NJ3D5R4D and VT are state forecasts; KS 4R is not, because of the space character between the S and the 4. (The intent is that the party results represent the number of seats that various parties are expected to win in that state; a state forecast with no party results means the polls are so inconclusive that a prediction can not be made for even one seat.)
A poll data string is a sequence of zero or more state forecasts, with exactly one comma separating one state forecast from the next state forecast, and with no other character that is not part of a state forecast in that string. No comma precedes the first state forecast or follows the last state forecast. For example, CT5D,NY9R16D1I,VT,ne3r00D is a poll data string consisting of four state forecasts; KS4R, NV3D1R is not a poll data string, because the space character between the comma and the N is not part of any state forecast. The empty string is a poll data string consisting of zero state forecasts.
These are the semantics of a poll data string: A poll data string represents a collection of predictions, one for each state forecast in that string. Each state forecast represents the prediction of the number of seats each indicated party in the listed party results will win in the state whose code is the state code; the digits in the party results represent those predicted numbers. For example, the poll string NY9R16D1I,VT,NJ3D5R4D,KS4R means that for the state NY, the predicted number of seats won will be 9 for party R, 16 for party D, and 1 for party I; for the state VT, no predictions; for the state NJ, 5 for party R and 7 for party D (3 for D and 4 more for D); for the state KS, 4 for party R.
Your task
Your assignment is essentially to take a poll data string and a party letter (in either upper or lower case), and compute the number of seats the poll data string predicts that party will win. For example, in the poll data string NY9R16D1I,Vt,NJ3d5r4D,KS4R the predicted number of seats for party D is 23 (16 from NY and 7 from NJ); for party R is 18 (9 from NY, 5 from NJ, and 4 from KS); and for party I is 1 (from NY).

For this project, you will implement the following two functions, using the exact function names, parameter types, and return types shown in this specification. (The parameter names may be different if you wish.)

bool isValidPollString(string pollData)
This function returns true if its parameter is a poll data string (i.e., it meets the definition above), or false otherwise.

int countSeats(string pollData, char party, int& seatCount)
If the parameter pollData is not a poll data string (i.e., it does not meet the definition above), this function returns 1. If the parameter party is not a letter, this function returns 2. (If both of these situations occur, return one of those occurring situations' return values; it's your choice which one.) If either of the preceding situations occur, then when the function returns, seatCount must have the same value it had just before any statements in the function were executed. If neither of those situations occurs, then the function returns 0 after setting seatCount to the total number of seats that pollData predicts the party indicated by party will win.

These are the only two functions you are required to write. (Hint: countSeats may well call isValidPollString.) You may write functions in addition to these two if you wish. While we won't test those additional functions separately, using them may help you structure your program more readably.

Of course, to test the functions you write, you'll want to write a main routine that calls your functions. During the course of developing your solution, you might change that main routine many times. As long as your main routine compiles correctly when you turn in your solution, it doesn't matter what it does, since we will rename it to something harmless and never call it (because we will supply our own main routine to thoroughly test your functions).

There are a couple of situations that would be important to deal with properly in the real world that we won't make you deal with to keep things simpler:

If a poll data string contains two or more forecasts for the same state, countSeats does not have to work correctly. We guarantee we will not test that function with poll data strings like IA3R,Ia1D or VA7R,KS4R,VA4D or VT,VT.
If a state forecast in a poll data string indicates a total number of seats that is not the real world number of seats for the state, countSeats must believe what the poll data string says. Thus, counting D seats in GA86D must yield 86, even though Georgia really has only 14 seats in the House of Representatives.
Programming Guidelines
The functions you write must not use any global variables whose values may be changed during execution. Global constants are allowed.

When you turn in your solution, neither of the two required functions, nor any functions you write that they call, may read any input from cin or write any output to cout. (Of course, during development, you may have them write whatever you like to help you debug.) If you want to print things out for debugging purposes, write to cerr instead of cout. cerr is the standard error destination; items written to it by default go to the screen. When we test your program, we will cause everything written to cerr to be discarded instead — we will never see that output, so you may leave those debugging output statements in your program if you wish.

The correctness of your program must not depend on undefined program behavior. Your program must never access out of range positions in a string. Your program must not, for example, assume anything about n's value at the point indicated, or even whether or not the program crashes:

	int main()
	{
	    string s = "Hello";
	    int n;              // n is uninitialized
	    s.at(5*n/n) = '!';  // undefined behavior!
	    …
Be sure that your program builds successfully, and try to ensure that your functions do something reasonable for at least a few test cases under both g31 and either Visual C++ or clang++. That way, you can get some partial credit for a solution that does not meet the entire specification.

If you wish, you may use this isValidUppercaseStateCode.txt function as part of your solution. (We can't imagine why you would not want to use it, since it does some of the work of validating a supposed state code.)

Your program must not use library facilities for matching regular expressions. (These ususally involve "regex" somewhere in the name.) If you don't know what this paragraph is talking about, then there's nothing for you to worry about.

There are a number of ways you might write your main routine to test your functions. One way is to interactively accept test strings:

	int main()
	{
	    for (;;)
	    {
	        cout << "Enter poll data string: ";
	        string pds;
		getline(cin, pds);
		if (pds == "quit")
		    break;
		cout << "isValidPollString returns ";
		if (isValidPollString(pds))
		    cout << "true";
		else
		    cout << "false";
		cout << endl;
	    }
	}
While this is flexible, you run the risk of not being able to reproduce all your test cases if you make a change to your code and want to test that you didn't break anything that used to work.

Another way is to hard-code various tests and report which ones the program passes:

	int main()
	{
	    if (isValidPollString("CT5D,NY9R16D1I,VT,ne3r00D"))
		cout << "Passed test 1: isValidPollString(\"CT5D,NY9R16D1I,VT,ne3r00D")" << endl;
	    if (!isValidPollString("ZT5D,NY9R16D1I,VT,ne3r00D"))
		cout << "Passed test 2: !isValidPollString(\"ZT5D,NY9R16D1I,VT,ne3r00D")" << endl;
	    int seats;
	    seats = -999;    // so we can detect whether countSeats sets seats
	    if (countSeats("CT5D,NY9R16D1I,VT,ne3r00D", 'd', seats) == 0  &&  seats == 21)
		cout << "Passed test 3: countSeats(\"CT5D,NY9R16D1I,VT,ne3r00D", 'd', seats)" << endl;
	    seats = -999;    // so we can detect whether countSeats sets seats
	    if (countSeats("CT5D,NY9R16D1I,VT,ne3r00D", '%', seats) == 2  &&  seats == -999)
		cout << "Passed test 4: countSeats(\"CT5D,NY9R16D1I,VT,ne3r00D\", '%', seats)" << endl;
	    …
This can get rather tedious. Fortunately, the library has a facility to make this easier: assert. If you include the header <cassert>, you can call assert in the following manner:

	assert(some boolean expression);
During execution, if the expression is true, nothing happens and execution continues normally; if it is false, a diagnostic message is written to cerr> telling you the text and location of the failed assertion, and the program is terminated. Using assert, we can write the tests above more easily (This is a very incomplete set of test cases):

	#include <iostream>
	#include <cassert>
	using namespace std;

	bool isValidPollString(string pollData)
	{
	    … Your code goes here …
	}

	int countSeats(string pollData, char party, int& seatCount)
	{
	    … Your code goes here …
	}

	int main()
	{
	    assert(isValidPollString("CT5D,NY9R16D1I,VT,ne3r00D"));
	    assert(!isValidPollString("ZT5D,NY9R16D1I,VT,ne3r00D"));
	    int seats;
	    seats = -999;    // so we can detect whether countSeats sets seats
	    assert(countSeats("CT5D,NY9R16D1I,VT,ne3r00D", 'd', seats) == 0  &&  seats == 21);
	    seats = -999;    // so we can detect whether countSeats changes seats
	    assert(countSeats("CT5D,NY9R16D1I,VT,ne3r00D", '%', seats) == 2  &&  seats == -999);
	    …
	    cerr << "All tests succeeded" << endl;
	}
The reason for writing one line of output at the end is to ensure that you can distinguish the situation of all tests succeeding from the case where one function you're testing silently crashes the program.
